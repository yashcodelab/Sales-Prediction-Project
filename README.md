# Sales-Prediction-Project

* Project Overview:-

This project aims to predict sales based on advertising expenditures across different platforms (TV, Radio, Newspaper). The project was completed as part of my Codesoft Data Science Internship.

* Dataset:-

1. The dataset contains the following columns:
2. TV: Advertising budget spent on TV (in thousands of dollars)
3. Radio: Advertising budget spent on Radio (in thousands of dollars)
4. Newspaper: Advertising budget spent on Newspaper (in thousands of dollars)
5. Sales: Units sold (in thousands)

* Tools & Technologies Used

Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)

Jupyter Notebook

GitHub

* Approach:-

1. Data Loading & Cleaning: Loaded the dataset and handled any missing values.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed relationships between features using correlation matrices and scatter plots.
3. Model Building: Trained multiple regression models to predict sales.
4. Model Evaluation: Compared model performance using metrics such as R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

* Results:-

1. The Linear Regression model performed the best with an R-squared score of 0.897, indicating that 89.7% of the variability in sales was explained by the advertising budget.

2. TV advertising had the highest impact on sales, followed by Radio, while Newspaper showed minimal impact.

* Key Insights:-

Investing more in TV and Radio advertisements is likely to result in higher sales.

Newspaper ads may not be cost-effective for driving sales.

* Conclusion:-

This project provided valuable insights into how different advertising platforms affect sales and demonstrated the power of linear regression for making data-driven decisions.
